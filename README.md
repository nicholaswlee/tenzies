# Welcome to Tenzies
I learned how to code in React using this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8)!
Tenzies is a fun game that challenges users to strategize in selecting and rolling for 10 of the same dice. It utilizes concepts such as useState and useEffect as well as unified state to allow users to interact with the application. Additionally, it utilizes localStorage to store a users high score!
